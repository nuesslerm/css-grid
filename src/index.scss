// The font path used in the font-awesome package is relative to the package itself
// when you're pulling font awesome into your style file that path breaks b/c it's
// now starting from this file instead of from node_modules.
// You can override that path by setting this variable relative to the node_modules
// folder. When webpack is loading the scss file it uses (actually the sass loader
// prob uses) the tilde(~) character to say "starting at node_modules".
